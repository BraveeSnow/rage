# rage - A Portage Management Tool

rage is a management tool written in rust for Gentoo's package manager portage.
It allows the user to sort their flags in the package.use directory.

## Features

Currently, rage only supports sorting USE flags. However, here are some
features that are planned to be released over time:

- [x] USE flag sorting
- [ ] Enabling/disabling USE flags for packages
